## Basic Concepts

- An array stores a sequence of values that are all the same type. You can either loop the values by the sequence or access each individual value by index.
- *2D-array:* Array can have one or 2-dimensions array.
- *Fixed Capacity:* Must give the specific array length when you initial the array, since it need to set the memory for it.
- *Dynamic array:* Since the array has a fixed capacity and we need to specify the size of the array when we initialize it. We need dynamic array which with variable size.
